# providence2

This is a clean rebuild of [Providence](https://github.com/providence-replay), an open-source session replay tool I originally built to help developers understand user behavior through AI-generated summaries and chat-based querying.


The purpose of this rebuild is to:
- **Deepen my architectural understanding** by reconstructing each part from scratch
- **Reflect on engineering decisions** I made originally and document what I'd change
- **Prepare for scaling/production-readiness** scenarios by improving modularity and clarity

Rather than treating this as a “new project,” I’m treating it as a learning artifact — something that shows how I think, build, and improve my own work over time.

### Key Features
- RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) with OpenAI for summarization
- Backend design for storing and querying sessions
- Replay dashboard with chat interface
- Async API design and modular data pipelines
